# ðŸš¨ FORCE NETLIFY REDEPLOY

This file forces Netlify to redeploy with our Prisma fixes.

## What We Fixed

1. âœ… **Removed platform-specific esbuild** causing installation issues
2. âœ… **Updated Prisma schema** with `directUrl` for direct connections  
3. âœ… **Fixed build script** to work without Linux dependencies
4. âœ… **Environment variables** are properly configured

## Why This Redeploy is Needed

- **Netlify Functions are compiled/bundled**
- **Old Prisma client is still running** in production
- **New schema changes** need to be deployed
- **Functions need to be rebuilt** with updated Prisma client

## Expected Result After Redeploy

- âœ… **Prisma connections working**
- âœ… **Database queries successful** 
- âœ… **No more `prisma://` protocol errors**
- âœ… **Functions using updated schema**
