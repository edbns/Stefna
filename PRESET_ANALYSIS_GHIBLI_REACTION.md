  Light anime influence limited to facial shading and catchlights; do not stylize neck, clothing, or background.
  ```
- **Risk Analysis**: Face-only anime stylization = low identity risk, but strength too low

## üìä **SUMMARY STATISTICS**

- **Total Presets**: 3
- **High Risk**: 0 presets (0%)
- **Moderate Risk**: 3 presets (100%)
- **Low Risk**: 0 presets (0%)

## üéØ **CURRENT STATUS: NEEDS OPTIMIZATION**

**All Ghibli Reaction presets have the same issue:**

1. **Strength values**: All at 0.06 (below safe range 0.12-0.18)
2. **Risk**: May cause "passthrough" (no visible change) due to too-low strength
3. **Identity preservation**: Excellent - face-only approach prevents drift
4. **Visual impact**: May be too subtle to notice

## üîß **RECOMMENDED ACTIONS**

**Immediate optimization required** - Increase strength values:

1. **rx_tears**: `0.06` ‚Üí `0.14` (optimal for tear effects)
2. **rx_shock**: `0.06` ‚Üí `0.14` (optimal for shock expressions)
3. **rx_sparkle**: `0.06` ‚Üí `0.14` (optimal for sparkle effects)

## üìù **TECHNICAL NOTES**

- **Purpose**: Eliminate "double face" and anime drift without adapters
- **Approach**: Two-pass system with identity preservation guards
- **Scope**: Face-only micro-anime stylization
- **Body/background**: Remain completely photorealistic
- **Identity preservation**: Built into every prompt template
- **Strength policy**: Server-clamped to 0.12-0.18 range

## üöÄ **ADVANTAGES**

1. **Low drift risk**: Face-only modifications
2. **Identity preservation**: Built-in guards prevent unwanted effects
3. **Consistent results**: Same approach across all ghibli presets
4. **Professional quality**: Subtle anime influence without full stylization
5. **Photorealistic body**: Background and body remain unchanged

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **CURRENT LIMITATIONS**

1. **Strength too low**: 0.06 may cause "passthrough" (no visible change)
2. **Subtle effects**: May be too subtle for users to notice
3. **Limited visual impact**: Current strength may not produce desired anime effects

## üìã **USAGE RECOMMENDATIONS**

- **Best for**: Portrait photography with subtle anime influence
- **Ideal subjects**: People with clear facial features
- **Avoid**: Subjects with heavy makeup or obscured faces
- **Expected results**: Subtle anime stylization on face only, photorealistic body/background

## üîß **OPTIMIZATION IMPACT**

**After strength increase (0.06 ‚Üí 0.14):**

1. **Visible effects**: Users will see the anime stylization
2. **No passthrough**: Strength high enough to produce changes
3. **Maintained safety**: Still within identity-preserving range
4. **Better user experience**: Clear visual feedback
5. **Professional results**: Optimal balance of effect and safety

## üìä **COMPARISON WITH OTHER PRESET TYPES**

| Preset Type | Current Strength | Safe Range | Status | Action Required |
|-------------|------------------|------------|---------|-----------------|
| **Professional** | 0.65-0.80 | 0.12-0.22 | ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH RISK | Immediate fix |
| **Emotion Mask** | 0.07 | 0.10-0.15 | ‚úÖ OPTIMAL | None |
| **Ghibli Reaction** | 0.06 | 0.12-0.18 | ‚ö†Ô∏è TOO LOW | Increase strength |
| **Neo Tokyo Glitch** | 0.05-0.06 | 0.20-0.30 | ‚ö†Ô∏è TOO LOW | Increase strength |

## üéØ **FINAL RECOMMENDATION**

**Ghibli Reaction presets are well-designed but need strength optimization:**

1. **Keep current prompts**: Excellent identity preservation
2. **Increase strength**: 0.06 ‚Üí 0.14 for all presets
3. **Maintain approach**: Face-only, body/background photorealistic
4. **Monitor results**: Ensure anime effects are visible but not overwhelming
