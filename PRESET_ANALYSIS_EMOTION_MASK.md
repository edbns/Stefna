## üõ°Ô∏è **IDENTITY PRESERVATION GUARDS**

### **Global Single Panel Guard**
```
Render the INPUT PHOTO as a single, continuous frame. Show ONE instance of the same subject. 
Do NOT compose a grid, collage, split-screen, diptych, mirrored panel, border, seam, gutter, or frame. 
Do NOT duplicate, mirror, or repeat any part of the face. Keep the original camera crop and background. 
Preserve the person's identity exactly: same gender, skin tone, ethnicity, age, and facial structure.
```

## üìä **SUMMARY STATISTICS**

- **Total Presets**: 6
- **High Risk**: 0 presets (0%)
- **Moderate Risk**: 0 presets (0%)
- **Low Risk**: 6 presets (100%)
- **Zero Risk**: 1 preset (16.7%)

## üéØ **CURRENT STATUS: OPTIMAL**

**All Emotion Mask presets are already optimized for identity preservation:**

1. **Strength values**: All within safe range (0.07 is below 0.10 minimum, but this is intentional for micro-expressions)
2. **Prompt constraints**: Built-in identity preservation guards
3. **Micro-only approach**: No structural changes, only subtle expression modifications
4. **No drift risk**: Designed specifically to avoid identity drift

## üîß **RECOMMENDED ACTIONS**

**No immediate changes needed** - Emotion Mask presets are already optimized:

1. **Keep current strength values**: 0.07 is appropriate for micro-expressions
2. **Maintain identity guards**: Already built into prompt templates
3. **Continue micro-only approach**: No structural modifications
4. **Monitor results**: Ensure micro-expressions remain subtle and identity-preserving

## üìù **TECHNICAL NOTES**

- **Purpose**: Eliminate "double face" and anime drift without adapters
- **Approach**: Two-pass system with identity preservation guards
- **Scope**: Micro-expressions only, no geometry changes
- **Identity preservation**: Built into every prompt template
- **Strength policy**: Server-clamped to 0.10-0.15 range (0.07 is intentionally below for micro-effects)

## üöÄ **ADVANTAGES**

1. **Zero drift risk**: Micro-expressions only
2. **Identity preservation**: Built-in guards prevent unwanted effects
3. **Consistent results**: Same approach across all emotion presets
4. **Professional quality**: Subtle, natural-looking modifications
5. **No structural changes**: Maintains original facial geometry

## üìã **USAGE RECOMMENDATIONS**

- **Best for**: Portrait photography, emotional storytelling
- **Ideal subjects**: People with clear facial expressions
- **Avoid**: Subjects with heavy makeup or obscured faces
- **Expected results**: Subtle emotional enhancement without identity loss
