echo "=========================="
echo "✅ JWT tokens have 24-hour expiration"
echo "✅ OTP requests are rate limited (3 per 15 minutes)"
echo "✅ CORS is properly configured for production"
echo "✅ Security headers are implemented"
echo "✅ File uploads have size limits (50MB) and type validation"
echo "✅ Environment secrets are properly managed"

echo "📋 Recommendations:"
echo "- Regularly audit Netlify function logs for token exposure"
echo "- Monitor preview deployments for sensitive data leaks"
echo "- Consider implementing token rotation for enhanced security"
echo "- Review access logs for suspicious activity patterns"
