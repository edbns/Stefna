üß† Unreal Reflection‚Ñ¢ ‚Äì Nano Banana Optimized (v2.0)

Unreal Reflection‚Ñ¢
"Not who you are. Who you could've been."
A photoreal, alternate-identity remix powered by Nano Banana.
Think: a version of you from a mirror-dimension, dream-state, or forgotten past life.
Identity-adjacent, not fantasy. Stylized, not cosplay.
Built for scroll-stopping visuals that feel mysterious, ethereal, and beautiful.

Enhanced prompts optimized for Nano Banana's verbosity preferences:
- The Syndicate: Feared inner circle of power, tailored suits, cinematic underworld
- Yakuza Heir: Raw power and style, irezumi tattoos, Osaka street scenes
- The Gothic Pact: Gothic royalty in timeless black fashion, candlelit scenes
- Y2K Paparazzi: Ultra-sexy fashion-forward icons, night scene, paparazzi flash
- Medusa's Mirror: Greek muse glam, flowing fabrics, marble ruins
- Chromatic Bloom: Dark magazine cover style with animal symbols

All presets use optimized strength (0.55) and guidance (7.5) for Nano Banana.

The lighting changes with the setting: golden light spilling through blinds in a smoky private room, the cold blue of a deserted garage lit by a single bulb, or warm streetlights reflecting off wet pavement at night.\n\nThe environment suggests wealth and secrecy ‚Äî places like a hidden lounge with leather chairs and cigars, an abandoned luxury hotel lobby, a rain-soaked parking lot beside a black Mercedes, or a curtained backroom of a club.\n\nThe mood is tense and cinematic, but completely real ‚Äî as if this was a leaked photo from the underworld, capturing their authority without posing. Always photorealistic, fashion-forward, and intimidating.',

Their makeup is minimal yet captivating: luminous skin, bold eyeliner, or strong lips. Each female figure may also be accompanied by only one powerful animal symbol: a black dog at their side, a snake coiled around the body, or a raven perched nearby. Never combine more than one animal per subject.\n\nFor couples, the balance is clear: each person styled distinctly with their own presence and possibly one animal each.

Women leaning against stone with fabric flowing, seated with a snake draped across the shoulders, or walking mid-frame with a doberman at her side.
