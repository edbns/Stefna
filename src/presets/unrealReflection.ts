🧠 Unreal Reflection™ – Nano Banana Optimized (v2.0)

Unreal Reflection™
"Not who you are. Who you could've been."
A photoreal, alternate-identity remix powered by Nano Banana.
Think: a version of you from a mirror-dimension, dream-state, or forgotten past life.
Identity-adjacent, not fantasy. Stylized, not cosplay.
Built for scroll-stopping visuals that feel mysterious, ethereal, and beautiful.

Enhanced prompts optimized for Nano Banana's verbosity preferences:
- Black Bloom: Botanical portrait with black flowers, mystical midnight garden
- Yakuza Heir: Raw power and style, irezumi tattoos, Osaka street scenes
- Blueberry Bliss: Futuristic latex fashion in deep blue and lilac palette
- Y2K Paparazzi: Ultra-sexy fashion-forward icons, night scene, paparazzi flash
- Medusa's Mirror: Greek muse glam, flowing fabrics, marble ruins
- Chromatic Bloom: Dark magazine cover style with animal symbols
- Chromatic Smoke: Dynamic smoke fashion with rotating color injection

All presets use optimized strength (0.55) and guidance (7.5) for Nano Banana.

    prompt: 'Transform this exact woman into a sculptural high-fashion vision, emerging from cracked and fractured stone. She wears a structured mini dress crafted entirely from marble, granite, or obsidian plates, layered and cut to fit her form like brutalist couture. The stone plates vary in size: some angular and geometric, others smooth and organic — always resting cleanly on her body with visible seams, cracks, and broken edges. The dress is thickest at the hips and chest, tapering sharply at the waist and collarbones, forming strapless, halter, or asymmetric cuts.\n\nFragments of stone float mid-air near her shoulders or behind her — suspended in motion, like pieces just shattered off her body. Some cracks glow faintly, not with light, but with depth — a sense of something ancient finally splitting open.\n\nHer skin remains exposed in intentional places — neck, arms, legs — flawless and untouched, contrasting the texture of the dress. Her pose is tall and poised, with one arm bent or relaxed, legs firmly planted, and her eyes looking straight at the camera with calm defiance — like a woman who was once a statue, now stepping out to judge the world.\n\nHair is slicked back, braided, or wrapped in a crown — minimal and structured. Makeup is grayscale glam: sculpted contour, matte lips, sharp shadow lines — no gloss, no softness.\n\nThe background is a surreal broken landscape: scattered marble slabs, overcast skies, and columns cracked in half. Light filters through dust in the air, casting diagonal shadows across her body and fractured dress.\n\nLighting is moody and sculptural: low from one side, with hard edge light on the shoulders and cheekbones. Shadows emphasize the depth of each stone layer — like she\'s both architecture and rebellion.',

Her dress is made from torn fabric ribbons, knotted yarn, and delicate fibers that drape across her body like sculptural sashes. Some parts cling tightly around the torso or hips, others unravel freely off her shoulders or sleeves — always artistic, always intentional.\n\nLoose threads drift in the air around her, some still attached to her outfit, others fully airborne — curling gently like smoke or ribbon. Their movement adds softness, but also tension: she\'s being unraveled, and she doesn\'t care.\n\nHer pose is open and grounded: shoulders back, arms at her sides or slightly lifted, and her gaze is downward or directly to camera — not passive, but reflective. Skin is visible in areas where fabric gaps: arms, collarbones, legs — smooth and untouched.\n\nHer hair is soft but styled: long and waved, tucked low into a bun, or partially braided — but always with a few loose strands. Makeup is faded elegance: light blush, blurred lips, slightly glossy skin, under-eye shadow or liner that hints at softness and emotion.\n\nThe background is a pale dusk or surreal indoor space, like a forgotten textile studio or misty cathedral wall — faded fabrics and threads may float behind her, forming a circular thread "halo" if seen from the right angle. Light leaks softly through a torn curtain or broken window, casting long shadows and warm glow across the threads.',

Her dress is formed from delicate but sharp ice-like floral layers, stacked in a couture silhouette that wraps the body: strapless or one-shoulder, cinched at the waist, blooming outward at the hips and skirt. The ice petals glisten subtly, some with cracks or frost edging, others smooth like carved crystal.\n\nHer face must not appear frozen or emotionless. Skin is softly lit, expressive, and alive — cheeks may glow faintly from the cold, lips show natural tone or a hint of chilled gloss, but the eyes remain human, engaged, and subtly powerful. She may gaze directly into the camera or slightly past it, with a quiet inner presence — not distant or artificial.\n\nHair is clean and sculpted: low bun, sleek braid, or tucked behind the ears. No heavy frost buildup — perhaps just a few delicate ice sparkles near the hairline or on the crown.\n\nShe stands in a cold, cinematic world — a snowy field, frozen lake, or icy plateau behind her. Soft frost drifts around her, and light mist rises from the ground. Her skin contrasts beautifully with the icy dress — a human flame wrapped in cold bloom.\n\nLighting is sharp and cold-toned: edge lighting from behind or a soft icy glow from above. Shadows fall in cool grays and frosted blues, highlighting the texture of the petals and the grace of her pose.\n\nPose is elegant and grounded — arms softly down or one hand lifted, standing with poise.

She stands confidently in a powerful pose, her body facing forward, head tilted subtly, eyes locked onto the camera with a calm, haunting intensity — as if she\'s inviting the storm.\n\nHer outfit forms a sculptural black mini dress made entirely from overlapping feather clusters. The feathers are layered like scales, sharp at the edges, blooming outward from the waist to form a textured silhouette. The neckline may vary — strapless, halter, or one-shoulder — but always follows the shape of natural feather flow. The dress cinches at the waist, flares softly at the hips, and exposes smooth skin at the arms, collarbones, and legs. It\'s wild, but elegant — a fashion sculpture, not a costume.\n\nAround her, black crows spiral and slash through the air, some blurred by motion, others frozen mid-flight with wings wide. Floating feathers drift downward or curl in the wind, caught in the chaos. A few stray feathers lift from her shoulders and hips, blending her body into the storm.\n\nThe background is vast and cinematic — a dark sky torn open with wind and clouds, muted silver light leaking through, creating contrast against her skin. She stands in a field of dead grass, shadows and wind circling her like a prophecy.\n\nLighting is dramatic and otherworldly: rim-lit from behind and below, accentuating feather textures, cheekbones, and collarbones. Skin glows softly, untouched by shadow. Her silhouette is unmistakable: tall, elegant, mythic.\n\nHer hair is sleek and controlled — either pulled back into a low bun, twisted braid, or slicked behind the ears. Makeup is fierce but clean: smoky eyeliner, pale matte lips, feathered brows. No jewelry. No distraction. Just her, the feathers, and the storm.\n\nThe mood: not horror. Not fantasy. Ritual high fashion. She is not prey. She is the omen.',
