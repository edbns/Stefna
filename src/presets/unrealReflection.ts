üß† Unreal Reflection‚Ñ¢ ‚Äì Nano Banana Optimized (v2.0)

Unreal Reflection‚Ñ¢
"Not who you are. Who you could've been."
A photoreal, alternate-identity remix powered by Nano Banana.
Think: a version of you from a mirror-dimension, dream-state, or forgotten past life.
Identity-adjacent, not fantasy. Stylized, not cosplay.
Built for scroll-stopping visuals that feel mysterious, ethereal, and beautiful.

Enhanced prompts optimized for Nano Banana's verbosity preferences:
- Black Bloom: Botanical portrait with black flowers, mystical midnight garden
- Yakuza Heir: Raw power and style, irezumi tattoos, Osaka street scenes
- Blueberry Bliss: Futuristic latex fashion in deep blue and lilac palette
- Y2K Paparazzi: Ultra-sexy fashion-forward icons, night scene, paparazzi flash
- Medusa's Mirror: Greek muse glam, flowing fabrics, marble ruins
- Chromatic Bloom: Dark magazine cover style with animal symbols
- Chromatic Smoke: Dynamic smoke fashion with rotating color injection

All presets use optimized strength (0.55) and guidance (7.5) for Nano Banana.

No heavy makeup, only natural sharpness and intensity. Each male figure is accompanied by only one powerful animal symbol:\n- a black doberman seated or standing at their side,\n- or a coiled snake wrapped naturally around the arm, shoulder, or waist,\n- or a raven perched close, on stone or shoulder.\nOnly one animal should appear, never more than one per subject.\n\nIf female, they wear minimal but striking couture gowns or dresses ‚Äî plunging necklines, bare shoulders, or sleek fitted silhouettes in dark tones such as black, storm grey, wine red, or deep emerald. Their makeup is minimal yet captivating: luminous skin, bold eyeliner, or strong lips. Each female figure may also be accompanied by only one powerful animal symbol: a black dog at their side, a snake coiled around the body, or a raven perched nearby. Never combine more than one animal per subject.\n\nFor couples, the balance is clear: each person styled distinctly with their own presence and possibly one animal each. For groups, they form a dark editorial tableau ‚Äî each unique, animals appearing sparingly, never overlapping.\n\nTheir posture rotates naturally ‚Äî men standing tall with a snake coiled along the arm, seated with a dog by their side, or turning in shadow with a raven perched near. Women leaning against stone with fabric flowing, seated with a snake draped across the shoulders, or walking mid-frame with a doberman at her side. Expressions remain calm, regal, and untouchable.\n\nThe scenery changes with the mood:\n- a cinematic studio set with dramatic spotlight and deep shadow,\n- an abandoned warehouse with broken windows and dust,\n- a stone courtyard at dusk with faint mist,\n- a rooftop at night with the skyline behind,\n- a candlelit interior with velvet curtains and cracked marble floors.\n\nLighting is professional and dramatic ‚Äî sharp contrasts, golden dusk, pale moonlight, or a single spotlight cutting through shadow.\n\nThe result must feel photoreal, stylish, and unforgettable ‚Äî a world where dark couture and symbolic animals define power and beauty.',
