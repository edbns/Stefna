üß† Unreal Reflection‚Ñ¢ ‚Äì Nano Banana Optimized (v2.0)

Unreal Reflection‚Ñ¢
"Not who you are. Who you could've been."
A photoreal, alternate-identity remix powered by Nano Banana.
Think: a version of you from a mirror-dimension, dream-state, or forgotten past life.
Identity-adjacent, not fantasy. Stylized, not cosplay.
Built for scroll-stopping visuals that feel mysterious, ethereal, and beautiful.

Enhanced prompts optimized for Nano Banana's verbosity preferences:
- Black Bloom: Botanical portrait with black flowers, mystical midnight garden
- Yakuza Heir: Raw power and style, irezumi tattoos, Osaka street scenes
- Blueberry Bliss: Futuristic latex fashion in deep blue and lilac palette
- Y2K Paparazzi: Ultra-sexy fashion-forward icons, night scene, paparazzi flash
- Medusa's Mirror: Greek muse glam, flowing fabrics, marble ruins
- Chromatic Bloom: Dark magazine cover style with animal symbols
- Chromatic Smoke: Dynamic smoke fashion with rotating color injection

All presets use optimized strength (0.55) and guidance (7.5) for Nano Banana.
