ðŸ§  Parallel Selfâ„¢ â€“ Nano Banana Optimized (v1.0)

Parallel Selfâ„¢
"Not who you are. Who you could've been."
A photoreal, alternate-identity remix powered by Nano Banana.
Think: a version of you from a mirror-dimension, dream-state, or forgotten past life.
Identity-adjacent, not fantasy. Stylized, not cosplay.
Built for scroll-stopping visuals that feel mysterious, ethereal, and beautiful.

Enhanced prompts optimized for Nano Banana's verbosity preferences:
- Rain Dancer: Cinematic rain scene with emotional depth and resilience
- The Untouchable: Grayscale fashion portrait with minimalist power
- Holiday Mirage: Golden-hour luxury fantasy with tropical blur
- The One That Got Away: Fleeting moment after gala with dramatic lighting
- Nightshade: Futuristic silhouette in glowing white minimalism
- Afterglow: Post-party shimmer with vintage dream texture

All presets use optimized strength (0.54â€“0.6) and guidance (7.0â€“7.5) for Nano Banana.

      prompt: 'Transform this person, couple, or group of people in the photo into high-fashion editorial figures captured in dramatic black and white.\n\nFemale Styling She may appear in one of several looks â€” but only one outfit per image:\n* A form-fitting black string-lace dress â€” plunging neckline, high slit, or open back.\n* Only A sharp black blazer worn as a dress no pants â€” sculpted shoulders, deep neckline, strong silhouette.\nFabrics are matte and structured: satin, silk, or modern stretch that sculpts the body. Shoes are minimal but sharp: strappy black sandals or pointed heels. Makeup is bold but refined â€” smoky eyes, contoured lips, luminous skin. Her presence is calm, confident, statuesque.\n\nMale Styling He may appear in one of several grounded and masculine outfits â€” but only one look per image:\n* A fitted black crewneck or short-sleeve T-shirt tucked into tailored trousers.\n* A structured black shirt, buttoned or slightly open, with rolled sleeves and strong shoulders.\n* A clean-cut black jacket worn over a bare chest or a fitted base layer, paired with heavy trousers.\nFabrics are classic and weighty: cotton, canvas, denim, wool. The styling emphasizes sharp structure and presence, never soft or ornamental. Footwear is solid and minimal: black leather boots or square-toed dress shoes. No jewelry. No accessories. No fashion tricks. The overall look must feel masculine, confident, and quietly commanding.\n\n\nCouples When a male and female subject appear together, each keeps their distinct styling as above (one outfit each, not combined). Their poses may vary naturally: one seated, the other standing; standing close with contrast in silhouette; walking mid-frame in motion.\n\nGroups In group compositions, only one subject may sit â€” always on the old wooden chair with visible metal legs. The remaining subjects stand around them, each facing forward directly toward the camera with a calm, composed posture.\nThere is no overlapping or symmetry â€” each figure holds their own space clearly, standing with relaxed arms, feet slightly apart, and body fully visible. No turning, leaning, or motion poses.\nEach person wears only one outfit as defined above â€” no repetition or mixing. The arrangement should feel bold and grounded, like a high-fashion cast captured in a single, iconic frame. Every subject looks confident, strong, and still.\nleaning against a wall in profile, fabric draping around her curves, - walking mid-frame with the slit of the dress catching motion, - head tilted back, confident gaze or eyes half-closed in calm dominance. Her expression is magnetic and unapologetic â€” calm, powerful, and deeply sensual without exaggeration. The background is minimal and moody: a studio void in shadow, a faint stone texture, or a cinematic set in deep black tones. Lighting is sharp and professional: dramatic contrasts, high detail, every contour of their body \n\n\nChair A single old wooden chair with visible metal legs anchors the scene. It is worn, raw, and cinematic. Only one chair per frame.\n\nScene & Background The room is empty and raw: dark gray walls with paint stains and rough texture, subtle fog in the air. The chair is the only prop. The floor is cold, reflective stone or concrete.\nleaning against a wall in profile, fabric draping around her curves, - walking mid-frame with the slit of the dress catching motion, - head tilted back, confident gaze or eyes half-closed in calm dominance.

The background is minimal and moody: a studio void in shadow, a faint stone texture, or a cinematic set in deep black tones.

The result is sharp, cinematic, and entirely black and white â€” every fabric fold, skin texture, and silhouette revealed in detail.\n\nâš¡ Key Condition: Each generated image must show a single outfit and a single pose choice per subject. Never blend multiple outfits or poses into one frame.\nThe final result must feel photoreal, modern, and iconic â€” like a single timeless frame from a fashion campaign.',
